                  ------------ Crazy Eights ------------
In this game you will be dealt 7 cards and each turn you will have the 
opportunity to play a card. In order to play a card it must match either the 
suit or numeric value of the previously played card. This rule can be broken 
if the card that is being played is an 8. When an 8 is played the player who 
played it may designate the suit of the card that must be played next. 

From there play continues, player by player, until one player is out of cards. 

If a player cannot play a card on their turn they must draw one card. It is 
then the next player's turn. 

Enjoy the game!
